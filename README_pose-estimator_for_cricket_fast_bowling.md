# Pose Estimator with Angle Extraction, Wrist Speed and KMeans Clustering

This project focuses on analyzing bowling technique from a **side-view video** using **MediaPipe Pose Estimation**. It computes joint angles (Landmarks) and wrist speed to provide biomechanical insights. All computed angles and metrics are exported to CSV for further analysis.

## Features

- Pose landmark extraction with **MediaPipe**
- Angle calculation between key joints (e.g., shoulder, elbow, wrist, leg)
- Linear wrist speed tracking during bowling motion
- CSV export of angle and motion data
- Designed for **side-on camera perspective**
- Visualizations and Pandas-based data manipulation
- Per-feature **KMeans Clustering**
- Visualizations to understand bowlerâ€™s pose dynamics
- Focused on a **single bowler scenario**

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nswordman062413/CricketPoseEstimation.git
```

Open **.ipynb in Jupyter Lab**:

Ensure you have a compatible video input (clear side view of bowler).

---

### How It Works

1. **Video Input**:
   - Process each frame with MediaPipe to extract pose landmarks.

2. **Angle Calculations**:
   - Compute joint angles using vector math (e.g., elbow angle from shoulder-elbow-wrist).
   - Export angle data to a CSV file for each frame.

3. **Wrist Speed Estimation**:
   - Calculate linear wrist movement velocity across frames.
   - Visualize speed variation throughout the bowling action.

4. **CSV Export**:
   - Output includes timestamps, angles, and wrist speed.
   - Ready for further biomechanical or coaching analysis.

5. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extract pose features such as joint angles, limb distances, and coordinate data.
   - Normalize and clean data per feature.

6. **Clustering with KMeans**:
   - Perform KMeans clustering **per feature** to better isolate movement patterns.
   - Visualize and compare clustered poses to detect variation or errors in technique.

7. **Output Analysis**:
   - Cluster labels stored per frame.
   - Visualizations help interpret biomechanical movement clusters.

## Notes

- Video must clearly capture the bowler's side profile.
- Designed primarily for **right-arm bowlers**, can be adapted for left-arm bowlers with minor changes.
- Wrist speed is approximate and based on pixel movement across frames.
- Designed for analysis of training/performance video
- Highly customizable for different pose features or clustering techniques


---

## Future Work

- Add support for automatic phase segmentation (run-up, jump, release)
- Enhance wrist speed accuracy with real-world calibration
- Integrate multi-angle multi-person video analysis
